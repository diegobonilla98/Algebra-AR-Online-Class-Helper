An augmented reality based tool to get more information about algebraic equations.

## How does it work?
First you select the region of interest dragging the mouse. Then a Neural Network converts the pixels to characters ([Google Tesseract](https://opensource.google/projects/tesseract)). A symbolic algebraic programming algorithm is performed to solve and get information about equations.

## Disclaimer
This is more a proof of concept than a finished product. Although the results are real, the OCR is pretty bad. Unfortunately I don't have time to work on this stuff, but anyone is welcomed to continue the work.
