# Algebra-AR-Online-Class-Helper
An augmented reality based tool to get more information about algebraic equations. [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6815539787986935808/). [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKWXDPF0pgc&ab_channel=DiegoAI).

## How does it work?
First you select the region of interest dragging the mouse. Then a Neural Network converts the pixels to characters ([Google Tesseract](https://opensource.google/projects/tesseract)). A symbolic algebraic programming algorithm is performed to solve and get information about equations.

## Disclaimer
This is more a proof of concept than a finished product. Although the results are real, the OCR is pretty bad. Unfortunately I don't have time to work on this stuff, but anyone is welcomed to continue the work.
